## InGame Info XML

Concepts and code derived from InGame Info XML.

![InGame Info XML](https://github.com/Lunatrius/InGame-Info-XML) was originally created by DaftPVF, known as ![Ingame Info](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/124117-/#ingame_info). DaftPVF went on a ![hiatus](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/124117-/page__st__920#entry12634055) in February 2012. At that time ![bspkrs](https://github.com/bspkrs/) took over the development. InGame Info XML development started with Minecraft 1.2.5 (everything was rewritten from scratch) and both versions have been kept up to date with each other up until 1.6.4.
